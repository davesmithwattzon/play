# Playing around with Offline

Base on https://css-tricks.com/serviceworker-for-offline/ with a few issues fixed.

To run

    python3 -m http.server

will make the app available as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

I've tested this just far enough to inspect the cache via the Chrome Developer tools.

## TO DO

Put together a manifest, add as a desktop app, and test going offline.
